# export-163-blog

NetEase blog is dead in my opinion, even though they are still running this service now. The service has been in unstable state for a long time, it seems that most of their resources were handed over to lofter.com which I have no interest in. 

I tried to contact the custom service and asked for the export feature, they told me they did not support that. And I believe that this really very important feature will be opended to the public until they shutdown the blog service completely. 

That's why I created this project.
