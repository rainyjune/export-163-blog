# export-163-blog

NetEase blog is dead in my opinion, even though they are still running this service now. The service has been in unstable state for a long time, it seems that most of their resources were handed over to lofter.com which I have no interest in. 

They do provide the export service, but it's not free. You have to be a VIP user and then can export your blog posts as HTML files.

That's why I created this project.
